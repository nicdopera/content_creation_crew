##CONTENT BRIEF
A reflective and empowering piece targeting young adults struggling with the pressures of their twenties. The narrative takes a warm, mentor-like approach, using metaphorical imagery of nature and growth to convey the message that personal development is not a race. The content aims to provide comfort and perspective to viewers aged 18-29 who feel overwhelmed by societal expectations.

##FORMAT
3 x 10-second shots

##SHOT1
0s
A young person sits alone on a rooftop at golden hour, overlooking a bustling city, the expression thoughtful and slightly worried
5s
The camera slowly circles around him as time-lapse clouds race overhead
10s
The scene transitions to show multiple versions of the same person walking different paths in a beautiful garden maze

##SHOT2
0s
Split screen showing the same person in different scenarios - studying in a library, laughing with friends at a cafe, working late at a startup
5s
The splits begin to merge as the person walks forward, leaving the different versions behind
10s
They approach a mirror in a sunlit room, their reflection showing them smiling confidently

##SHOT3
0s
The person stands at the edge of a forest clearing, surrounded by seedlings and fully grown trees
5s
As they walk through the forest, each tree they pass represents a different life milestone, some trees tall, others still growing
10s
The final frame shows them sitting peacefully under a young but healthy tree, writing in a journal, surrounded by soft natural light

##NARRATOR SCRIPT
"Dear twenty-something me, I see you there, carrying the weight of a thousand expectations...
Trying to sprint through chapters that were meant to be savored...
Here's what I wish I knew: There's no single path to success...
No universal timeline for finding yourself...
Like these trees in the forest, we all grow at our own pace...
Your journey is uniquely yours, and that's what makes it beautiful."

##MUSIC PROMPT
Style - Ambient Electronic
Tempo - 80-85 BPM
Mood - Contemplative, Uplifting
